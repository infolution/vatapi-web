European Union has different tax policy than United states. The concept of VAT (Value Added Tax) is implemented in all EU member countries.
Detailed differences of sales tax and VAT are out of the scope of this article. There are many resources on the web that explain it.

For you, as a company, it's important that European Union (EU) customers must pay VAT for products and services they buy. It applies only to B2C segment.
Companies from EU that purchase electronic services don't need to pay VAT on electronic services.

What does it mean for US based company that supplies electronic services, and digital products like

* websites
* web hosting
* music
* games
* software
* etc. ([complete list](/about/))

You have to charge EU customers with price that includes VAT tax with tax rate from their country.

Let me try to illustrate it with an example. Let's say you sell your game for $12.00 to a customer from United Kingdom. The process of calculating thr right price is outlined below.

<div class="row">
<div class="large-2 column">
    Your price
</div>
<div class="large-2 column">
    VAT rate
</div>
<div class="large-2 column">
    VAT (Tax)
</div>
<div class="large-4 column end">
    Amount you charge customer
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="large-2 column">
    <strong>$ 12</strong>
</div>
<div class="large-2 column">
    <strong>20 %</strong>
</div>
<div class="large-2 column">
    <strong>$ 2.40</strong>
</div>
<div class="large-4 column end">
    <strong>$ 14.40</strong>
</div>
</div>

As you can see it's fairly easy to calculate the price for an UK customer.

The problem is that there are 28 EU Member countries, each with their own tax rate.

#Obligations for US company

US company must collect taxes from every EU customer, and then quarterly transfer that money to EU country.


The procedure for collecting VAT and transferring to EU country is simplified in such way that US company doesn't have to register in every EU country in which it sells their products and services.
I will explain it in my next article.
